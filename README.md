Each week I will add a new document (or several) to this repository.  
To access the documents efficiently and turn them in, we are going to practice GitHub.

1.  Click the "Fork" button in the upper right of the webpage, which will make an identical copy of this repo in your personal GitHub account.
2.  In order to work on the document Weekly Session 2, you will need to clone/download the repository.  
    * Last week We tried this with the GitHub desktop software - a GUI (graphical user interface).
      If you prefer to use it, we an figure it out, but I found it more confusing and less helpful than I'd hoped.  
      Instead, lets do this with the terminal this week.
    * Open the "Git Shell" navigate to your favorite directory using the 'cd' (change directory) command:
      $ cd
